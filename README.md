## Summary
This repository holds the baseCap Security Helpers for seamless async encryption and decryption. No custom encryption is written here; this is more of an abstraction over the built-in encryption code in order to provide seamless integration to automated processes (such as the [BaseCap Cloud Abstractions](https://github.com/BaseCap-Analytics/CloudAbstractions)).
